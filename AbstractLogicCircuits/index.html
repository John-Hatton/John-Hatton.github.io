 <h4 id="a-small-collection-of-logic-gates-and-some-basic-circuits">A Small Collection of Logic Gates and some Basic Circuits</h4>


 <p>This is the README for the Abstract Logic Circuits library. Its inception began while I was doing some out of the ordinary
  research for my Computer Structures/Architecture class. I spent a fair amount of time learning about the x86 Processor,
  specifically the x86_64 newer variants, and I wanted a way to simulate what I was learning in some sort of game.
  Thankfully I didn&#39;t have to go far, and found myself building basic circuits in Fallout 4. I downloaded the PC version,
  and fitted it with a few mods that are must-have for this sort of thing. The first is the ASP - Advanced Settlement
  Power. This one is the back-bones of what I was able to accomplish, and is well cited as the same for the second.
  The second mod was CLC - Complex Logic Circuits. This mod promised to give users a real x86 in the Wasteland, yet it
  was not to be. I was greatly inspired by CLC though, which is in large part why I&#39;ve chosen a similar name, out of
  respect. Sadly the last version of the DLL that the author shipped with the latest CLC release was only good for
  Fallout 4 version 1.10.64. The newest version (I could find) was version 1.10.163, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m on.
  Unfortunately, it&#39;s quite difficult to find an older version of the game, but the mod still offers a few additional
  tools that aren&#39;t present in ASP. Another note is that either the original author or one of the original authors of ASP
  has started a new project called ASPr, or ASP Redux. It&#39;s a new version, with some massive overhauls, as well as some
  interesting goals to add new functionality to the project. I&#39;ll be very interested in seeing how that goes.</p>


 <p>For now the inception of this project is some sort of Node Graph Editor. I&#39;d like to be able to create AND gates and
  XOR gates, and so on, and create my own Logic Circuits from those initial gates.</p>
